                <u><h2>SUPRA MK4</h2></u>
                <p>
                    In 2019, the fifth-generation Supra was unveiled as a coupe-only model. Its predecessor had a targa version but that was not the case anymore. The Supra featured a very aggressive design with a sharp nose and headlights. It wasn't only the glorious history of the car, but also because it had a BMW engine in it.But we all have to admit the bulky shapes of the fourth-gen Supra are looking somewhat outdated in the world we are living in today. The automakers build sharper and more angular sports cars nowadays and The Sketch Monkey decided to keep the cars gorgeous proportions and update the design with new wheels, graphics, and small details. The overall inspiration for the redesign comes from the current Supra, which has slightly different proportions and sharper lines.Compared to todays Supra, the MK4 had slightly less power. The model thats on sale today offers 382 hp (285 kW) and 368 lb-ft (500 Nm) of torque in the US specification.
